# Salary Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the salary of individuals based on their age and years of experience. The model uses a linear regression algorithm to predict salary by establishing a relationship between these two factors.

## Features
- **Linear Regression Model**: Implements linear regression using `scikit-learn` to predict salary based on the input features (age and experience).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
- **Visualization**: Plots the relationship between the features (age, experience) and the predicted salary.

## Dataset

The dataset should contain the following columns:
- **Age**: The age of the individual.
- **YearsExperience**: The number of years the individual has worked.
- **Salary**: The salary of the individual (target variable).
